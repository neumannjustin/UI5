<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The 3 Main Folders</div><div type="The 3 Main Folders">
			
			<p class="p">The 3 main folders in an application are the <span class="ph filepath">root</span> folder, the
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder and the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder.
				Regarding their structure, the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder should be inside
				the <span class="ph filepath">root</span> folder, and the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder
				should be located inside the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder, as show below:</p>

				<p class="p">The image above shows a screenshot taken from SAP Web IDE, and is only meant to serve as an
					example. This applies to all images contained within this topic.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">root</span> Folder</span></p>

			<p class="p">The root folder should contain files that are not part of your application coding.
				Examples are build configuration files, such as a <span class="ph filepath">pom.xml</span> for
				maven or a <span class="ph filepath">Gruntfile.js</span> for node/grunt, and documentation files
				like <span class="ph filepath">readme.md</span> or <span class="ph filepath">txt</span>. These files may
				also be grouped in folders if needed. For example, you could group all documentation
				files into a <span class="ph filepath">doc</span> folder.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> Folder</span></p>

			<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder contains all the code that is related to the
				application. This means running and extending the application using the
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">extensibility</span> mechanism offered by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. This includes
				the JavaScript files for the logic, view files written in xml, html, json or js
				format, and also files for <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">localization</span>, such as
					<span class="ph filepath">i18n.properties</span> files. Any files that are only relevant for
				testing should be put inside the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder. For more details
				about the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder, see the section below. For more
				information about extensibility and localization, see <a class="xref" href="a264a9abf98d4caabbf9b027bc1005d8.html">Extending Apps</a> and <a class="xref" href="91f217c46f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html">Localization</a> respectively.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">test</span> Folder</span></p>

			<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder contains all of the files needed for running automated
				tests for your application, as well as for launching your application in a sandbox
				mode so that you can do manual testing. For more details about the
					<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder, see the section below.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Why Use 3 Separate Folders?</span></p>

			<p class="p">To achieve sound performance when loading your application, the code you deploy to your
				production servers should only contain a <span class="ph filepath">component-preload.js</span>
				and a <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file. This means that when you create a
				package with a build, it is easier if all the files you really want to deploy are
				inside <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">one</span> folder. This is true no matter which build framework
				you use. We recommend using the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder for this. Nothing
				inside the <span class="ph filepath">root</span> folder is needed for running the app, so it's
				not included on a production server serving your application. The content of the
					<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder has to be executed in design time and during
				the automated test execution on a central server. We choose to include it inside the
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder, to be able to reference resources of the
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder relatively to the <span class="ph filepath">test</span>
				folder. This folder has to be excluded when you are building a
					<span class="ph filepath">component-preload.js</span>. You should never reference resources
				of the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder from your application, because when you
				deploy to a productive environment, the resource cannot be loaded. For more
				information about the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file, see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The webapp Folder in Detail</div><div type="The webapp Folder in Detail"><p class="p">Aside from the <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder, the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder contains
				3 folders related to the MVC (model, view, controller) pattern used in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, as well as a
				localization folder and a local-services folder used for emulating OData services.
				Each of these folders is outlined below.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_cd2_rbb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_skn_sbb_zs" src="loio5d11418f5cdf4eac85c9dc7784a97df1_LowRes.png"/></div></div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">view</span> Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">In the <span class="ph filepath">view</span> folder, you should put all <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
				<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">views</span> and <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">fragments</span>. This folder should
				not contain any application logic, so no JavaScript files unless you are using
				JavaScript views. JavaScript views are not recommended because it is easier to mix
				controller logic when building up a view. In declarative views this is not possible.
				In the example shown below, the <span class="ph filepath">view</span> folder contains a mixture
				of views and fragments. If this folder gets too big, you might consider adding
				subfolders to group views by their semantics. In this example for instance, you
				could add a <span class="ph filepath">detail</span> folder and move all views that are related
				to the detail area of your application to this subfolder.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_crm_5bb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_ghm_kcb_zs" src="loiod5340cbbd7ae423db38ed4b8b236daf2_LowRes.png"/></div></div>

			<p class="p">For more information about views and fragments, see <a class="xref" href="91f27e3e6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html">Views</a> and <a class="xref" href="36a5b130076e4b4aac2c27eebf324909.html">Reusing UI Parts: Fragments</a> respectively.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">controller</span> Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">controller</span> folder contains all the controllers used by your views, and
				might also contain additional logic files that are used by one or more controllers.
				The structure of the <span class="ph filepath">controller</span> folder should mirror the
					<span class="ph filepath">view</span> folder. If a view is in a subfolder, the controller of
				the view should also be in the corresponding subfolder.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_zsx_vbb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_mmw_lcb_zs" src="loio0e935c5607ed4ca3bf910ff267416245_LowRes.png"/></div></div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">model</span>
				Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">model</span> folder is where you put any files needed for creating models and
				logic relating to model data. This includes grouping, filtering and formatting
				data.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_aqd_xbb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_k3d_ncb_zs" src="loiof990b6e5f10c4386835d49495dc4259c_LowRes.png"/></div></div>
<p class="p">In the above example, <span class="ph filepath">models.js</span> is a factory for creating models that are
				used by our application.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Localization Folder -
					<span class="ph filepath">i18n</span></span></p>
<p class="p">We also have one dedicated folder for <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">localization</span> files. An <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> app will
				potentially be translated into many languages. Each of those languages has its own
					<span class="ph filepath">.properties</span> file. Note that although the
					<span class="keyword apiname">ResourceModel</span> is an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> model from a
				technical point of view, the localization folder is <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> part of
				the <span class="ph filepath">model</span> folder. This is because the
					<span class="ph filepath">.properties</span> files have a different semantic since they are
				used for translation. The code needed to instantiate the
					<span class="keyword apiname">ResourceModel</span> is located in the <span class="ph filepath">model</span>
				folder. For more information about localization, see <a class="xref" href="91f217c46f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html">Localization</a>. <span class="ph">For more
					information about the <span class="keyword apiname">ResourceModel</span>, see the <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel.html">API Reference</a> in the Demo
					Kit.</span></p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">The <span class="ph filepath">localService</span> Folder</span></p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">localService</span> folder is used to emulate OData services for tests or as a
				preview mode for your application. It is also intended for design-time tools since
				it contains the <span class="ph filepath">metadata.xml</span> file, which describes the backend
				connection of your application. You need to have one
					<span class="ph filepath">metadata.xml</span> file per OData service, which exactly matches
				the remote service’s metadata. The location of this file also needs to be maintained
				in the data sources section of the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file. For more
				information, see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_y2m_xbb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_pl5_4cb_zs" src="loio00728aff82c54419b1d7acd61c76455f_LowRes.png"/></div></div>
<p class="p">For integration tests, it is helpful if you are able to mock your backend with stable data. A
				second use case for this is for running an application in a
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">preview</span> mode so that it serves data locally instead of
				connecting to a backend. This is why this folder also contains files necessary for
				starting up a mock server. The data served by the mock server is put inside the
					<span class="ph filepath">mockdata</span> folder. If you need to, you can also include
				multiple sets of mock data here, by giving each set its own folder. For more
				information about mock servers, see the <span class="ph"><a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.core.util.MockServer.html">API Reference</a> in the Demo
					Kit.</span></p>

			<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder contains three sets of files: files related to unit
				tests, files related to integration tests, and html files for either launching the
				tests or for testing the application manually. Inside the <span class="ph filepath">unit</span>
				folder, the structure of the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder is replicated for
				the files that are being tested.</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_nyt_5cb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_dmh_zcb_zs" src="loio7958ae4e55c6419b90320a45cbcc72ae_LowRes.png"/></div></div>

			<p class="p">In this example shown above, the files being tested are
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp/model/formatter.js</span> and
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp/model/models.js</span>. You may be using JavaScript files
				or html files to run your tests, depending on the runners you are executing your
				tests with. We recommend using <span class="ph filepath">.js</span> files for writing your
				tests, so that you can run them with tools such as karma for instance.</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__fig_bqm_vcb_zs"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio003f755d46d34dd1bbce9ffe08c8d46a__image_ypw_zcb_zs" src="loio05316ff7b0c94c00afc68f25a67ee4cf_LowRes.png"/></div></div>

			<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">integration</span> folder contains the OPA tests of your application. We
				decided to separate our unit and integration tests, since the execution time of the
				integration tests is much longer. While the unit tests run in less than 10 seconds,
				the integration tests run for over 2 minutes. These times will vary a lot depending
				on the size of your project. If the project grows and grows, the difference in the
				execution time will also grow. For this reason, we recommend making both kind of
				tests separately executable so that developers can choose which sets of tests they
				want to run during design time.</p>

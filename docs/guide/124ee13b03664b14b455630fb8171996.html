<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><samp class="ph codeph">Upload Collection</samp> is a list control for attachment management that
		provides the ability to upload, edit or delete attachments.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control allows users to upload single or multiple files
			from their devices (desktop PC, tablet or phone) to an app. Due to its responsiveness,
			the upload collection can be used in containers of different sizes .</p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Overview</div><div type="Overview">
			
			<p class="p">You can use the <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control to show a list of files, for
				example, attachments or uploads, that can be modified, or you can allow users to add
				or remove files to or from this list. </p>

			<div class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control can be used in two different scenarios:<ul class="ul" id="loio124ee13b03664b14b455630fb8171996__ul_m3m_c5h_ys"><li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Instant Upload</span></p>

						<p class="p">This scenario allows users to upload single or multiple files from their
							devices (desktop, PC, tablet, or smartphone) and attach them to the
							application immediately. The selection and upload process is completed
							in one step and is automatically triggered by the
								<samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Upload Pending</span></p>

						<p class="p">With this UploadCollection scenario, you can select attachments and add them to the upload
							list (multiple selection is possible). You can cancel the upload of one
							file in this selection without canceling the upload of the other
							selected files. In a second step, you can upload the selected files. The
							application triggers the upload with an event. </p>

					</li>
</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">The following features are available:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio124ee13b03664b14b455630fb8171996__ul_ufq_2lm_qr"><li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Upload files</span></p>

					<p class="p">The upload is triggered by the <span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span> pushbutton (plus icon). Afterwards
						the OS-native file picker dialog appears and you can select one or multiple
						files. However, the consuming application need to enable the upload of
						multiple files by using the <samp class="ph codeph">multiple</samp> property during the
						instantiation. During the upload process, a progress indicator provides
						information about the status.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Open files</span></p>

					<p class="p">To open a listed file, you can choose the icon or thumbnail of the attachment as well as the
						filename itself. Depending on the file extension, browser capabilities, and
						device type (PC or mobile), the file is handled differently, for example, it
						is opened in a new tab or downloaded, if no display capability is available
						in the browser.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Rename files</span></p>

					<p class="p">Choosing on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Rename</span> pushbutton (pen icon) turns the file name into
						an input field and allows modification. You can confirm the renaming by
						choosing the <span class="ph uicontrol">OK</span> or cancel by choosing
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Cancel</span>. If the
							<samp class="ph codeph">sameFilenameAllowed</samp> property is set to
							<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>, the new file name is validated and, if the file
						name already exists in the current list, an error occurs, which indicates
						that you need to change the file name.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Delete files</span></p>

					<p class="p">You can delete files by using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> pushbutton (x icon with a
						circle). After choosing the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> pushbutton, a
						dialog appears, asking the user to confirm the deletion of the respective
						file that removes the file from the list.</p>

				</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">The two pushbuttons <span class="ph uicontrol">Rename</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> that are

				</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.UploadCollection</samp> control uses the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.unified.FileUploader</samp> control and contains dependencies
				to this control. If you want to use the <samp class="ph codeph">UploadCollection</samp> control,
				you need to be aware of these dependencies. <span class="ph">For more information about the

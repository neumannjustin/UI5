				and can be started manually by calling the <span class="ph filepath">opaTests.qunit.html</span>
				file in the same folder. Similar to the unit tests, the HTML page is a QUnit runner
				that calls all integration tests of the app and displays the test results in a
				readable format. It also might be omitted by other testrunners. There are also two
				namespaces defined for the app and the integration test folder as you have seen in
				the unit test setup.</p>

			<p class="p">We write integration tests with OPA5 – a tool that is integrated and delivered with SAPUI5. It
				is the short name for One-Page Acceptance tests for SAPUI5. "One-Page" here means
				that OPA5 is designed for single-page Web applications, i.e. applications that
				consist only of one HTML file. OPA5 runs in the same browser window as the
				application to be tested and opens a local iFrame to run the tests on the app.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">There is also a stand-alone version of OPA5 called <span class="q">“OPA”</span> available that can be used for

						<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>-specific
					functionality. In this tutorial, <span class="q">“OPA”</span> always refers to OPA5. It includes
					functionality for easily finding and matching <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
					controls as well as their
					properties and aggregations.</p>

			<p class="p">For structuring integration tests with OPA we use <span class="q">“journeys”</span>. A test journey

			<p class="p">The journey uses another structuring element of OPA called <span class="q">“page object”</span> that

			<p class="p">Let’s add our first new OPA test to the <span class="ph filepath">WorklistJourney.js</span> file. We
				describe all test cases related to the worklist logic. We can see that there is
				already a test <samp class="ph codeph">Should see the table with all posts</samp> defined that
				checks if the table contains the expected number of items. There is a function
					<samp class="ph codeph">opaTest</samp> that initiates a test description and receives a test
				description as the first argument as well as a callback function as the second
				argument. This format is similar to the unit test function
					<samp class="ph codeph">QUnit.test</samp> except for the three arguments of the callback
				function that are specific to OPA.</p>

			<p class="p">The three objects <samp class="ph codeph">Given</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">When</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">Then</samp> are
				filled by the OPA runtime when the test is executed and contain the
					<samp class="ph codeph">arrangements</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">actions</samp>, and
					<samp class="ph codeph">assertions</samp> for the test. The "Given-When-Then" pattern is a
				common style for writing tests in a readable format. To describe a test case, you
				basically write a user story. Test cases in this format are easy to understand, even
				by non-technical people.</p>

			<div class="p">Let’s give it a try with our new feature that only displays 20 posts in the table
				initially and will load more posts when we press a trigger button or scroll down.
				Here is our user story "Should see the table with all posts" and its code
					representation:<ul class="ul" id="loio1b47457cbe4941ee926317d827517acb__ul_rzp_jsr_jt"><li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Arrangements</span></p>

						<p class="p">Define possible initial states, e.g. the app is started, or specific data
							exists. For performance reasons, starting the app is usually done only
							in the first test case of a journey.
								<samp class="ph codeph">Given.iStartMyApp();</samp></p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Actions</span></p>

						<p class="p">Define possible events triggered by a user, e.g. entering some text,
							clicking a button, navigating to another page.
								<samp class="ph codeph">When.onTheWorklistPage.iPressOnMoreData();</samp></p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Assertions</span></p>

						<p class="p">Define possible verifications, e.g. do we have the correct amount of
							items displayed, does a label display the right data, is a list filled.
							At the end of the test case, the app is destroyed again. This is
							typically done only once in the last test case of the journey for
							performance reasons.
								<samp class="ph codeph">Then.onTheWorklistPage.theTableShouldHaveAllEntries
								().and.iTeardownMyAppFrame();</samp></p>

					</li>
</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">Please also note that you have to move the <samp class="ph codeph">and.iTeardownMyAppFrame()
				</samp>concatenation from the previous <samp class="ph codeph">opaTest</samp> function and put
				it at the end of the last test of a journey, in this case this is our new test. For
				performance reasons, we only start and destroy the app once per journey, as it takes
				several seconds to construct the iFrame and load the app. You can concatenate
				actions and assertions with the OPA helper object and in an easily readable way. The
				functions will be executed one after another.</p>

			<p class="p">Now you might wonder where all those descriptive functions and the helper object
					<samp class="ph codeph">onTheWorklistPage</samp> are coming from. The answer is simple, the
					<samp class="ph codeph">onTheWorklistPage</samp> object is a structuring element of OPA and
				inside we will implement the actions and assertions used in this test.</p>

			<p class="p">As you can see, the OPA page object is constructed with the call
					<samp class="ph codeph">Opa5.createPageObjects</samp> and a <samp class="ph codeph">configuration</samp>
				object that contains the actions and assertions properties. It also inherits commons
				functionality from a <samp class="ph codeph">Common</samp> base object that is located in the same
				folder and contains helper functions for starting the app.</p>

			<p class="p">For our test case we need to add an action <samp class="ph codeph">iPressOnMoreData</samp> and an
				existing assertion <samp class="ph codeph">theTableShouldHaveAllEntries</samp>. OPA tests are
				running asynchronously, so each action and assertion starts with a
					<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement. The OPA run time will check and wait for the
				condition to be fulfilled every 400 ms by polling. If the condition is met, the
					<samp class="ph codeph">success</samp> function of the configuration is called. If the
				condition is still not fulfilled after a certain amount of time (by default it is 15
				seconds but this can be configured) the test will fail.</p>

			<p class="p">Let’s start with the action <samp class="ph codeph">iPressOnMoreData</samp>. We define a
					<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement with the current view and the table. Those
				IDs are stored as internal variables in the <samp class="ph codeph">require</samp> statement above
				and are available in all tests. A so-called <samp class="ph codeph">matcher</samp>, another
				configuration object of OPA, is used for the evaluation of the test. The matcher
				must resolve to a Boolean value. If the matching condition is met, the
					<samp class="ph codeph">success</samp> function is invoked, if not the error message is
				displayed and the test fails. The condition in the <samp class="ph codeph">matcher</samp> checks
				for a DOM element called <samp class="ph codeph">trigger</samp> inside the table. If this element
				is found, the <samp class="ph codeph">success</samp> function will be invoked and we can simply
				trigger a jQuery tap event on it. With that our action is finished.</p>

			<p class="p">The assertion <samp class="ph codeph">theTableShouldHaveAllEntries</samp> is structured similarly,
				but it does not trigger an action. In an assertion we only do checks in a
					<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement and at least one check has to be successful
				to make the assertion pass. In this function, the <samp class="ph codeph">matcher</samp> is not a
				custom one as in the action above but an <samp class="ph codeph">AggregationLengthEquals</samp>
				matcher provided by OPA.</p>

			<div class="p">With this helper object we can simply check the length of the table aggregation items to the
				expected number of items. We have 23 entries in our local mock data that we also use
				for this integration test. You can see that the number of items is actually
				hard-coded in the test. So only if the table has exactly 23 items, the matcher is
				evaluating to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp> and the assertion is passed successfully. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">The items in our app are served from the mock server with a slight delay so
						that we can see how a real service on a backend system would behave. Even if
						we would have a real backend, we would purposely use the mock server for
						manual testing and for using them in our test cases as the test data remains
						stable and unchanged. This creates a more reliable test environment and
						easier tests. So we can write a test that checks exactly for 23 items
						here.</p>

				</div>
Now run the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html</span>
				file and make sure that the test is failing. As you can see, the app is opened in a
				small iFrame on the lower right and the tests are running there. When our new test
				is invoked, OPA will run into a timeout because the trigger area is not found yet.
				You can see more information, if you open the developer console of your browser and
				check the messages in the console.</div>

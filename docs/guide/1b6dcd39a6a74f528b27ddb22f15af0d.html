<h1 class="title topictitle1">Navigation and Routing</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In this tutorial we will introduce you to the navigation and routing features of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. Navigation and routing
		is essential in modern single-page applications such as apps built with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">In classical web applications, the server determines which resource is requested based on the
			URL pattern of the request and serves it accordingly. The server-side logic controls how
			the requested resource or page is displayed in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="p">In single-page applications, only one page is initially requested from the server and
			additional resources are dynamically loaded using client-side logic. The user only
			navigates within this page. The navigation is persisted in the hash instead of the
			server path or URL parameters.</p>
<p class="p"> For example, a classical Web application might display the employee’s resume page when URL
				<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/employees/resume.html?id=3</samp>
			or
				<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/employees/3/resume</samp>
			is called. A single-page application instead would do the same thing by using a
			hash-based URL like
				<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/#/employees/3/resume</samp>. </p>
<p class="p">The information in the hash, namely everything that is following the <samp class="ph codeph">#</samp> sign,
			is interpreted by the router. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> comes with a
			powerful routing API that helps you control the state of your application efficiently.
			This tutorial will illustrate all major features and APIs related to navigation and
			routing in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> apps by
			creating a simple and easy to understand mobile app. It represents a set of best
			practices for applying the navigation and routing features of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> to your
			applications.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">This tutorial does not handle cross-app navigation with the SAP Fiori launchpad. However, the
				concepts described in this tutorial are also fundamental for navigation and routing
				between apps in the SAP Fiori launchpad. </p>

		</div>
<div class="p">We will create a simple app displaying the data of a company’s employees to show typical
			navigation patterns and routing features. The complete flow of the application can be
			seen in the figure below. We'll start with the home page which lets users do the
				following:<ul class="ul" id="loio1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d__ul_z4g_yx4_ls"><li class="li">
					<p class="p">Display a <span class="ph uicontrol">Not Found</span> page</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Navigate to a list of employees and drill further down to see a
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Details</span> page for each employee</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Show an <span class="ph uicontrol">Employee Overview</span> that they can search and
						sort</p>

				</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d__fig_uzp_dcp_ls"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loio1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d__image_zlc_2cp_ls" src="loio92cdce7bddc44e27a66990708ce4b09f_HiRes.png"/><div class="figcap">Figure 1:
					Page Flow of the Final App</div></div></div>
<p class="p">Throughout this tutorial we will add features for navigating to pages and bookmarking them. We
			will add backward and forward navigation with common transition animations (slide, show,
			flip, etc.). We will add more pages to the app and navigate between them to show typical
			use cases. We will even learn how to implement features for bookmarking a specific
			search, table sorting via filters, and dialogs.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">This tutorial is based on <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
				version 1.30 or higher. The navigation features shown in this tutorial are available
				since version 1.28. However, the configuration via the descriptor  file
					<samp class="ph codeph">manifest.json</samp> is only available since 1.30.</p>

		</div>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
			<p class="p">You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step
				you want. Just download the code from the previous step, and start there.</p>

			<p class="p">You can view and download the files for all steps in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app
				in the Demo Kit <span class="ph">at <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.navigation/samples">Navigation and Routing</a></span>. Copy the code to your workspace and make sure that
				the application runs by calling the <samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html</samp> file.
				Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths
				and configuration entries.</p>

<li><strong><a class="link" href="df245bd449a7470c8c2a0926ca8d78de.html">Step 1: Set Up the Initial App</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">We start by setting up a simple app for this tutorial. The app displays mock data only 		and mimics real OData back-end calls with the mock server as you have seen in the 			Walkthrough tutorial.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="cf3c57c89ef0491793d1ce327ab4f9b2.html">Step 2: Enable Routing</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step we will modify the app and introduce routing. Instead of having the home 		page of the app hard coded we will configure a router to wire multiple views together when 		our app is called. The routing configuration controls the application flow when the user 		triggers a navigation action or opens a link to the application directly.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="e047e0596e8a4a1db50f4a53c11f4276.html">Step 3: Catch Invalid Hashes</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Sometimes it is important to display an indication that the requested resource was not 		found. To give you an example: If a user tries to access an invalid pattern which does not 		match any of the configured routes, the user is notified that something went wrong. You 		might also know this as a <span class="q">“404”</span> or Not Found Page from traditional web pages. In 		this step, we will implement a feature that detects invalid hashes and visualizes this in a 		nice way.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="66670b0aab3948469d5cc8276113e9ea.html">Step 4: Add a Back Button to Not Found Page</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">When we are on the Not Found page because of an invalid hash, we want to get back 		to our app to select another page. Therefore, we will add a Back button to the Not
			Found view and make sure that the user gets redirected to either the previous page 		or the overview page when the Back button is pressed.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d9efab307ecc42b180b12cc8956e22d7.html">Step 5: Display a Target Without Changing the Hash</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step you will learn more about targets and how to display a target from the 		routing configuration manually. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="782aac08f2de4003a2fcbdd39d27f374.html">Step 6: Navigate to Routes with Hard-Coded Patterns</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we'll create a second button on the home page, with which, we can navigate 		to a simple list of employees. This example illustrates how to navigate to a route that has 		a hard coded pattern.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="f96d2522a5ca4382a274ae3c6d002ca0.html">Step 7: Navigate to Routes with Mandatory Parameters</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we implement a feature that allows the user to click on an employee in the 		list to see additional details of the employee. A route pattern can have one or more 		mandatory parameters to identify objects in an app.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="3e5f6f3e163f46ecaef376950258e5e4.html">Step 8: Navigate with Flip Transition</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we want to illustrate how to navigate to a page with a custom transition 		animation. Both forward and backward navigation will use the <span class="q">“flip”</span> transition but with 		a different direction. We will create a simple link on the Employee 		view that triggers a flip navigation to a page that displays the resume data of a certain 		employee. Pressing the Back button will navigate back to the 			Employee view with a reversed flip transition.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="b8561ff6f4c34c85a91ed06d20814cd3.html">Step 9: Allow Bookmarkable Tabs with Optional Query Parameters</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">The <samp class="ph codeph">resume</samp> view contains four tabs as we have seen in the previous 		steps. However, when the user navigates to the <samp class="ph codeph">resume</samp> page, only the first 		tab is displayed initially. Navigating directly to a specific tab or bookmarking a tab is 		not yet supported in our current app.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="cdab0a1123514cc08cf2c8deb22f312e.html">Step 10: Implement Lazy Loading</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In the previous steps, we have implemented a Resume view that 		uses tabs to display data. The complete content of the tabs is loaded once, no matter which 		tab is currently displayed. We can increase the performance of our app by avoiding to load 		content that is not visible. Therefore, we implement a <span class="q">“lazy loading”</span> feature that only 		loads the view and data when requested by the user. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="b01840ec42ef48e6bfd2bc12612f501f.html">Step 11: Assign Multiple Targets</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we will add a new button to the home page to illustrate the usage of 		multiple targets for a route. If the button is clicked, a new page opens that contains two 		parts: a header part at the top and a content part. The content part displays a table of 		employees that can be sorted and searched. We will use the array notation in the routing 		config to assign multiple targets to a route - a feature that we have not yet 		introduced.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="e85da535ea19430a90c381f3c2bd748e.html">Step 12: Make a Search Bookmarkable</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step we will make the search bookmarkable. This allows users to search for 		employees in the Employees table and they can bookmark their search 		query or share the URL.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="39759878ae4f48dcad0cf34da1d299f0.html">Step 13: Make Table Sorting Bookmarkable</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we will create a button at the top of the table which will change the 		sorting of the table.. When the current sorting state of the table is changed, the sorting 		state will be reflected in the URL. This illustrates how to make the table sorting 		bookmarkable.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="5cc3147afc8d4854b5d3c5fc20923f77.html">Step 14: Make Dialogs Bookmarkable</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we want to allow bookmarking of the opened dialog when the user clicks the 		sorting button. The dialog should automatically open when the URL contains the query 		parameter <samp class="ph codeph">56</samp>. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="877d57e3b5654b19a2d2e5190dc43b0d.html">Step 15: Reuse an Existing Route</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">The employees table displays employee data. However, the resumes of the employees are 		not accessible from this view yet. We could create a new route and a new view to visualize 		the resume again, but we could also simply reuse an existing route to cross-link the resume 		of a certain employee. In this step, we will add a feature that allows users to directly 		navigate to the resume of a certain employee. We will reuse the 			Resume page that we have created in an earlier step. This example 		illustrates that there can be multiple navigation paths that direct to the same 		page.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="a7932a791adc4a58ae4693400801ea5f.html">Step 16: Handle Invalid Hashes by Listening to Bypassed Events</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">So far we have created many useful routes in our app. In the very early steps we have 		also made sure that a Not Found page is displayed in case the app was 		called with an invalid hash. Now, we proceed further and track invalid hashes to be able to 		detect and correct any invalid links or add new URL patterns that are often requested but 		not found. Therefore, we simply listen to the bypassed events</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4a063b8250f24d0cbf7c689821df7199.html">Step 17: Listen to Matched Events of Any Route</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In the previous step, we have listened for bypassed events to detect possible technical 		issues with our app. In this step we want to improve the analysis use case even more by 		listening to any matched event of the route. We could use this information for measuring how 		the app is used and how frequently the pages have been hit. Many Web analytics tools track 		page hits this way and the collected information can be used to improve our app and its 		usability.</div></li>

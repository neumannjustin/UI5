<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In this tutorial we will test application functionality with the testing tools that are
		delivered with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. At
		different steps of this tutorial you will write tests using QUnit, OPA5, and the mock
		server. Additionally, you will learn about testing strategies, Test Driven Development
		(TDD), and much more. </p>
<p class="p">For the application features that we add, we focus on writing clean and testable code
			with the goal of having good test coverage and a high quality app. We will create a
			simple full screen app that we will extend with more tests and features throughout the
			tutorial.</p>
<p class="p">Imagine the following situation: You and your development team take over a bulletin board
			prototype that will be shipped as a product soon. A bulletin board typically consists of
			functionality to browse posts and add own offers to the board. However, the prototype
			only covers a minimum set of features and tests so far.</p>
<p class="p">With this very minimalistic app as a starting point, we have a good foundation and we can
			inspect the most important testing functionality. Furthermore, we want to implement new
			features for the app that were requested by the product team using Test Driven
			Development and best practices for writing testable code and testing <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> apps.</p>
<p class="p">So why do we do all this? Obviously, writing tests and testable code does not come
			without effort. Well, we want to ensure the implementation of a high quality app by
			having decent test coverage of our application logic. And we check that our code does
			not break by running the automated tests whenever we change something or when we upgrade
			to a newer version of the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> framework or other
			external libraries. Additionally, we can find bugs proactively and do not need excessive
			manual testing anymore so the efforts definitely pay off. Also, when we decide to
			refactor something in the future, we can easily verify that the features of the app are
			still working as expected.</p>
<p class="p">There are a lot more reasons and many small details that we will address throughout this
			tutorial. You can work yourself through the steps by applying the code deltas
			individually or by downloading the samples for each step from the explored app and
			playing around with it. </p>

<li><strong><a class="link" href="ab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5.html">Step 1: Overview and Testing Strategy</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we will take a look at the prototype that was handed over to us and define 		the test strategy for our app. The prototype already contains the infrastructure for unit 		and integration testing and a minimum set of tests and features.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="b81736e0fcb246efb3b0cf0ca422f8fd.html">Step 2: A First Unit Test</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step we will analyze the unit testing infrastructure and write a first unit 		test. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="2bf4892527174264808076be32c1e1b0.html">Step 3: Adding the Price Formatter</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">We will now take care of the implementation of the price formatter and make sure that 		the tests we wrote in the previous step run successful. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="a5bb7a6d736f41c8ac1c1ef0b2d40676.html">Step 4: Testing a New Module</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In the first unit test we have just extended the formatters module with a new function. 		Now we will write a unit test that will test the functionality of an entirely new module. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="69a25bf2f8a2478cbda4b8bbe64039de.html">Step 5: Adding a Flag Button</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now that we have implemented the conversion tests, we add the corresponding 		functionality and show the button to flag a post in the app. The design team has specified 		that the flag feature should be implemented with a toggle button that has a flag 		icon.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="1b47457cbe4941ee926317d827517acb.html">Step 6: A First OPA Test</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">A bulletin board may contain many posts. We expect to have a high data load once it is 		officially released. Then, there might be performance issues and long loading times if we 		display all entries at the same time. Therefore we will introduce a feature that limits the 		initial display to 20 items. The user can then click on a more button to view more items. As 		with the unit test, we start by writing an integration test for this feature and then add 		the application functionality later.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="016e0d44f8ff47d2bdf4fdad9b7bf7cd.html">Step 7: Changing the Table to a Growing Table</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Letâ€™s switch back to developing and add the missing feature for the test we implemented 		in the previous step. We will simply change the table to a growing table as this is a basic 		feature of the table. This will display a trigger at the end of the table that the user can 		click on to display more items.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="10592affce3e4f1ba73c3125ee06e0b7.html">Step 8: Testing Navigation</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">So far, we have a list of posts on the home page of the app. But typically, a post 			comes with more details that should be displayed on a separate detail page. We call it 			the post page because it displays details of a post. In this step we will introduce a new journey to test the post page. We write tests that 			trigger typical navigation events with OPA. Testing navigation greatly helps in reducing 			manual testing efforts as they cover a lot of testing paths. It is good practice to 			cover every view of your application with at least one test, since OPA will check if an 			exception is thrown. In this way you can detect critical errors very fast.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4a9f063d4a4143d5b5c10416677f04b6.html">Step 9: Adding the Post Page</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now that we have covered all kinds of tests for navigation, we introduce our 			Post page that shows details of a post in the bulletin board. To 		achieve this, we have to introduce a new view/controller pair and adjust the routing of the 		application.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="07c97a2e497d443eb6fa74bb9445ab9c.html">Step 10: Test Suite and Automated Testing</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we will step back from our tests and application features that we have 		implemented so far and add another important piece of test code: The test suite page. A test 		suite can execute multiple tests and collect the results. This comes in handy for automatic 		tools in a continuous integration process.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="19ccd473c9a14c2ab7529303a2232d2c.html">Step 11: Testing User Interaction</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step we want to write a test that simulates user interaction with an icon tab 		bar. We want to change the tab and check if the correct content is shown.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="6e9c6bd2054c4425b7f15cac31aa675c.html">Step 12: Adding Tabs</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">We want to display statistics for an advertisement, for example, how many times it was 		viewed. To achieve this, we implement an icon tab bar with an Info 		tab and a Statistics tab. The existing content should be placed on 		the Info tab and the view count on the 			Statistics tab.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="bc4114a88e4d4ac1a0f53b2a7a92b226.html">Step 13: Writing a Short Date Formatter Using TDD</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">It's now time to improve the content of the Info tab. We want to 		see the Posted At date in a formatted way. Based on the age of the 		post, we either display the time, a textural representation of the day, or the date only. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="2ca583d6b9c24e4d8f189eada7c4b668.html">Step 14: Adding the Date Formatter</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Our formatter does its job, but it is not yet used. In this step we will use 		it.</div></li>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">SplitApp</samp> is a control that can act as a root element of an
				application for mobile and desktop devices. It is designed to be used as the base
				for applications following the master-detail pattern.</p>

			<p class="p">It maintains two <samp class="ph codeph">NavContainers</samp> if running on tablet or desktop, and
				one if running on a phone. In default mode, the master <samp class="ph codeph">NavContainer</samp>
				will always be displayed on desktop screens and on tablets in landscape mode. It
				will be hidden on tablet-sized screens and can either be swiped in and out (if the
				device is touch-enabled) or the visibility can be toggled by clicking a button. On
				phone devices, either the master <samp class="ph codeph">NavContainer</samp> or the detail
					<samp class="ph codeph">NavContainer</samp> will be shown, and a true forward-backward
				navigation is established between the two.</p>

			<p class="p">For more information, <span class="ph">see the
						<a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.SplitApp/samples">sap.m.SplitApp</a> samples
					in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app and <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.m.SplitApp.html">sap.m.SplitApp</a></span> in the <span class="ph uicontrol">API
					Reference</span> in the Demo Kit.</p>

			<p class="p">As the <samp class="ph codeph">SplitApp</samp> control inherits from
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitContainer</samp>, you can alter this behavior by setting
				the corresponding mode property. You can set this property to
					<samp class="ph codeph">StretchCompressMode</samp>, for instance, if you want the master to
				always be displayed on tablet-sized screens, irrespective of the current
				orientation. The different modes that are available are described under <span class="ph"><a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.m.SplitAppMode.html">sap.m.SplitAppMode</a></span> in the <span class="ph uicontrol">API
					Reference</span> in the Demo Kit.</p>

			<p class="p">One control that is widely used across all kinds of different applications is
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Table</samp>, which has several features you can use for device
				adaptation. On smaller devices, for example, you can set certain properties that
				will make particular columns pop in instead of being displayed as a normal column,
				or show and hide columns completely.</p>

			<p class="p">For example, you can set a <samp class="ph codeph">minScreenWidth</samp> for the columns. This will
				cause columns to only show up if a certain screen width is matched. You can define
				this <samp class="ph codeph">minScreenWidth</samp> in px or rem, but here you can also use the
				standard categories that come from the device API (Phone, Tablet, or Desktop). For
				more information about the device API, see <a class="xref" href="69a8e469fbde46e7b8916250080effbd.html">The Device API</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">Setting the additional property <samp class="ph codeph">demandPopin</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>
				for a column will also react to the <samp class="ph codeph">minScreenWidth</samp> you specify. In
				such a case, the column will be shown as a popin on smaller screens, instead of
				being completely hidden. For more information about responsive tables and their
				columns, <span class="ph">see
					the <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.Table/samples">sap.m.Table</a> and <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.Column/samples">sap.m.Column</a> samples in

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">sap.m.ResponsivePopover</div><div type="sap.m.ResponsivePopover">
			
			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">ResponsivePopover</samp> is actually a combination of the functionality
				offered by a <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Dialog</samp> and a <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Popover</samp>.
				Depending on the device it is displayed on, it will either act as the former (on a
				phone) or as the latter (on tablets and desktop). For reuse, it is best placed
				within a fragment, which will be instantiated and displayed on demand, like when a
				user clicks a certain button, for example.</p>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">ResponsivePopover</samp> does not need any additional properties to
				achieve proper device adaptation, it can simply be used "as is". There are, however,
				several properties that only take effect on one particular type of device, as some
				properties will not make any sense at all for a particular screen size.</p>

			<p class="p">For more details on these properties, <span class="ph">see the
					documentation and sample for <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.ResponsivePopover/samples">sap.m.ResponsivePopover</a>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">OverflowToolbar</samp> is a special type of toolbar that allows you to
				decide if elements within should go into an overflow area when space on the screen
				is limited. All elements going into the overflow area can then be reached by
				clicking the overflow button.</p>

			<p class="p">As a developer, you can decide if there are elements that will never or always go
				into the overflow area by adding overflow layout data to particular content.</p>

			<p class="p">For detailed examples and more information about the
				<samp class="ph codeph">OverflowToolbar</samp>, <span class="ph">see the
						<a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.OverflowToolbar/samples">sap.m.OverflowToolbar</a>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">PullToRefresh</samp> control allows users to trigger an update
				operation with touch or mouse interaction. On touch-enabled devices, the control
				will automatically be hidden, and users can swipe down the page to trigger it. On
				mouse-operated devices, the control will always be shown and can be clicked in order
				to trigger the functionality.</p>

			<p class="p">To use this control, it first needs to be placed within the content of any scroll
				container. In the corresponding controller, the refresh handler can be implemented,
				which in this use case would update the list of products in the view.</p>

			<p class="p">To see a full example and read more information about <samp class="ph codeph">PullToRefresh</samp>,

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.form.Form</samp> is a form that can also adapt to the
				available screen size, particularly when used with the corresponding
					<samp class="ph codeph">ResponsiveGridLayout</samp>. A form consists of
					<samp class="ph codeph">FormContainers</samp>, which in turn contain the fields and their
				labels. You can define general layout data for a form. For instance, you can decide
				how many columns you want to display depending on the available screen size, as
				shown here:</p>

			<div class="p"><div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint ">&lt;f:layout&gt;
	&lt;f:ResponsiveGridLayout
		columnsL="4"
		columnsM="2"/&gt;

(assuming
				that <samp class="ph codeph">f</samp> is declared as the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.form</samp>
				namespace under which the <samp class="ph codeph">ResponsiveGridLayout</samp> is also
				available.)</div>

			<p class="p">On a small screen, there will always be only one column for form containers.</p>

			<p class="p">Furthermore, you can define how much space labels will take when one or more columns
				are displayed, and you can also specify <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.GridData</samp> as
				layout data on the <samp class="ph codeph">FormContainers</samp>, labels and content fields, as
				the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.Grid</samp> is used internally in the form.</p>

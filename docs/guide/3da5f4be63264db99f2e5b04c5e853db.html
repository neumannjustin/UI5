<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In this tutorial we will introduce you to all major development paradigms of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">Despite the simplicity of the UI, we strive for a proper setup of modules, structuring of
			application code and adherence to code conventions. As such this tutorial represents a
			best practice for building apps with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">The UI might be a bit inconsistent in some places – don’t take it as a UI design
			guideline. We'll show you around using minimal code changes in each step.</p>
<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
			<p class="p">Some steps of this tutorial use features that are only available as of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> version 1.30. If
				you use a lower version of the library you might not be able to see the expected
				result. Whenever suitable, we point out alternatives for lower releases.</p>

		</div>
<p class="p">We first introduce you to the basic development paradigms like <em class="ph i">Model-View-Controller</em> and
			establish the basic structure of our application. We'll do this along the classic
			example of “Hello World” and start a new app from scratch. Next, we'll introduce the
			fundamental data binding concepts of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> and extend our app
			to show a list of invoices. We'll continue to add more functionality by adding
			navigation, extending controls, and making our app responsive.Finally we'll look at the
			testing features and the built-in support tools of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>.</p>

<li><strong><a class="link" href="2680aa9b16c14a00b01261d04babbb39.html">Step 1: Hello World!</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">As you know <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is all about HTML5. Let’s get started with building a first “Hello 		World” with only HTML.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="fe12df2e338e43598977d09f3d191b7b.html">Step 2: Bootstrap</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Before we can do something with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, we need to load and initialize it. This process 		of loading and initializing <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is called <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">bootstrapping</span>. Once this 		bootstrapping is finished, we simply display an alert.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="ddbceecd7d3d42eea9cf78a820a238fb.html">Step 3: Controls</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now it is time to build our first little UI by replacing the “Hello World” text in the 		HTML body by the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> control 			<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Text</samp>. In the beginning, we will use the JavaScript control 		interface to set up the UI, the control instance is then placed into the HTML body. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="1409791afe4747319a3b23a1e2fc7064.html">Step 4: XML Views</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Putting all our UI into the <samp class="ph codeph">index.html</samp> file will very soon result in a 		messy setup and there is quite a bit of work ahead of us. So let’s do a first modularization 		by putting the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Text</samp> control into a dedicated <samp class="ph codeph">view</samp>. 			<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> supports multiple 		view types (XML, HTML, JavaScript). We choose XML as this produces the most readable code 		and will force us to separate the view declaration from the controller logic. Yet the look 		of our UI will not change.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="50579ddf2c934ce789e056cfffe9efa9.html">Step 5: Controllers</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we replace the text with a button and show the “Hello World” message when 		the button is chosen. The handling of this event is implemented in the controller of the 		view.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="f665d0de4dba405f9af4294de824b03b.html">Step 6: Modules</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step we replace the alert from the last exercise with a proper "Message Toast" 		from the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m library</samp>. The required modules are loaded 		asynchronously.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="70ef981d350a495b940640801701c409.html">Step 7: JSON Model</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now that we have set up the view and controller, it’s about time to think about the "M" 		in MVC. We will add an input field to our app, bind its value to the model, and show the 		user input when pressing the “Say Hello” button.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="df86bfbeab0645e5b764ffa488ed57dc.html">Step 8: Translatable Texts</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step we move the texts of our UI to a separate resource file. This way, they are 		all in a central place and can be easily translated into other languages. This process of 		internationalization – in short <samp class="ph codeph">i18n</samp> – is achieved in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> by using a special 		resource model and the standard data binding syntax. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4cfa60872dca462cb87148ccd0d948ee.html">Step 9: Component Configuration</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">After we have introduced all three parts of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept, we 		now come to another important structural aspect of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. In this step, we will 		encapsulate all UI assets in a component that is independent from our 			<samp class="ph codeph">index.html</samp> file. Components are independent and reusable parts used in 		SAPUI5 applications. Whenever we access resources, we will now do this relatively to the 		component (instead of relatively to the <samp class="ph codeph">index.html</samp>). This architectural 		change allows our app to be used in more flexible environments than our static 			<samp class="ph codeph">index.html</samp> page.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="8f93bf2b2b13402e9f035128ce8b495f.html">Step 10: Descriptor for Applications</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">All application-specific configuration settings will now further be put in a separate 		descriptor file called <samp class="ph codeph">manifest.json</samp>. This clearly separates the 		application coding from the configuration settings and makes our app even more flexible. For 		example, all SAP Fiori applications are realized as components and come with a descriptor 		file in order to be hosted in the SAP Fiori launchpad. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="3b9d9f84930d43df90ad0789d99bd4a3.html">Step 11: Pages and Panels</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">After all the work on the app structure it’s time to improve the look of our app. We 		will use two controls from the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp> library to add a bit more "bling" to 		our UI. You will also learn about control aggregations in this step.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4df1d914e52d4b1aa0805eb01522537e.html">Step 12: Shell Control as Container</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now we use a shell control as container for our app and use it as our new root element. 		The shell takes care of visual adaptation of the application to the device’s screen size by 		introducing a so-called letterbox on desktop screens.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="17b87fbafb5a4474982760d2a3a73e69.html">Step 13: Margins and Paddings</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Our app content is still glued to the corners of the letterbox. To fine-tune our layout, 		we can add margin and padding to the controls that we added in the previous step. But 		instead of manually adding CSS to the controls, we will use the standard classes provided by 		<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="723f4b2334e344c08269159797f6f796.html">Step 14: Custom CSS and Theme Colors</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Sometimes we need to define some more fine-granular layouts and this is when we can use 		the flexibility of CSS by adding custom style classes to controls and style them as we like. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="df8c9c3d79b54c928855162bafcd88ee.html">Step 15: Nested Views</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Our panel content is getting more and more complex and now it is time to move the panel       content to a separate view. We do this to have a more clear application structure or when we       want to create reusable artifacts for our app.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4da72985139b4b83b5f1c1e0c0d2ed5a.html">Step 16: Dialogs and Fragments</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we will take a closer look at another element which can be used to 		assemble views: fragment. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="354f98ed2b514ba9960556333428d35e.html">Step 17: Fragment Callbacks</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now that we have integrated the dialog, it's time to add some user interaction. The user 		will definitely want to close the dialog again at some point, so we add a button to close 		the dialog and assign an event handler.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="776f7352807e4f82b18176c8fbdc0c56.html">Step 18: Icons</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Our dialog is still pretty much empty. Since <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is shipped with a large icon font 		that contains more than 500 icons, we will add an icon to greet our users when the dialog is 		opened.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="19453962b8074b7399372c65cbe05370.html">Step 19: Reuse Dialogs</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In step 16 we created a dialog as fragment, because wanted it to be reusable across 		views or across our whole app. But we placed the logic for retrieving the dialog instance 		and for opening and closing it respectively in the controller of the 			<samp class="ph codeph">HelloPanel</samp> view. Sticking to this approach would require copying and 		pasting the code to the controller of each view that needs our dialog. This would of course 		cause an undesired code redundancy we definitely want to avoid. In this step, we will 		implement the solution to this problem: We now expand our reuse concept and invoke the 		dialog at component level. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="bf71375454654b44af01379a3c3a6273.html">Step 20: Aggregation Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now that we have established a good structure for our app, it's time to add some more 		functionality. We start exploring more features of data binding by adding some invoice data 		in JSON format that we display in a list below the panel.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="dfe04650afc046e0802abb1a1a90d2d9.html">Step 21: Data Types</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">The list of invoices is already looking nice, but what is an invoice without a price 		assigned? Typically prices are stored in a technical format and with a '<samp class="ph codeph">.</samp>' 		delimiter in the data model. For example, our invoice for bread has the price 			<samp class="ph codeph">2.71212</samp> without a currency. We are going to use the  <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> data types 		to format the price properly.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="c98d57347ba444c6945f596584d2db45.html">Step 22: Expression Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Sometimes the predefined types of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> are not flexible enough and you want to do a 		simple calculation or formatting in the view, that is where expressions are really helpful. 		We use them to format our price according to the current number in the data 		model.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="0f8626ed7b7542ffaa44601828db20de.html">Step 23: Custom Formatters</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">If we want to do a more complex logic for formatting properties of our data model, we 		can also write a custom formatting function. We will now add a localized status with a 		custom formatter, because the status in our data model is in a rather technical 		format.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="5295470d7eee46c1898ee46c1b9ad763.html">Step 24: Filtering</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we add a search field for our product list and define a filter that 		represents the search term. When searching, the list is automatically updated to show only 		the items that match the search term.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="c4b2a32bb72f483faa173e890e48d812.html">Step 25: Sorting and Grouping</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">To make our list of invoices even more user-friendly, we sort it alphabetically instead 		of just showing the order from the data model. Additionally, we introduce groups and add the 		company that ships the products so that the data is easier to consume.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="44062441f3bd4c67a4f665ae362d1109.html">Step 26: Remote OData Service</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">So far we have only worked with local JSON data, but now we will access a real OData 		service. You can find many test services on the OData home page that we can use to connect 		our app to remote data. You will be surprised how few we have to change in order to make 		this work!</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="bae9d90d2e9c4206889368f04edab508.html">Step 27: Mock Server and Automatic Model Instantiation</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">We just ran our app against a real service, but for developing and testing our app we do 		not want to rely on the availability of the “real” service or put additional load on the 		system where the data service is located. This system is the so-called back-end system that 		we will now simulate with a <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> feature called mock server. It serves local files, but it 		simulates a back-end system more realistically than just loading the local data. We will 		also change the model instantiation part so that the model is configured with the descriptor 		and instantiated automatically by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. This way, we do not need to take care of the model 		instantiation in the code.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="e1ce1de315994a02bf162f4b3b5a9f09.html">Step 28: Unit Test with QUnit</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now that we have a test folder in the app, we can start to increase our test coverage. 		Actually, every feature that we added to the app so far, would require a separate test case. 		We have totally neglected this so far, so let’s add a simple unit test for our custom 		formatter function from Step 23. We will test if the long text for our status is correct by 		comparing it with the texts from our resource bundle.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="9bf4dce43b7943d0909cd6c58a933589.html">Step 29: Integration Test with OPA</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">If we want to test interaction patterns or more visual features of our app, we can also 		write an integration test. We haven’t thought about testing our interaction with the app 		yet, so in this step we will check if the dialog actually opens when we click the “Say Hello 		with Dialog” button. We can easily do this with OPA5, a feature of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> that is easy to 		set up and is based on JavaScript and QUnit. Using integration and unit tests and running 		them consistently in a continuous integration (CI) environment, we can make sure that we 		don’t accidentally break our app or introduce logical errors in existing code.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="1ff250c2038849f5991209f7e6c36f1f.html">Step 30: Debugging Tools</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Even though we have added a basic test coverage in the previous steps, it seems like we 		accidentally broke our app, because it does not display prices to our invoices anymore. We 		need to debug the issue and fix it before someone finds out. Luckily, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> provides a 		couple of debugging tools that we can use within the app to check the application logic and 		the developer tools of modern browsers are also quite good. We will now check for the root 		cause.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="e5200ee755f344c8aef8efcbab3308fb.html">Step 31: Routing and Navigation</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">So far, we have put all app content on one single page. As we add more and more 		features, we want to split the content and put it on separate pages. In this step, we will 		use the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> navigation features to load and show a separate detail page that we can later 		use to display details for an invoice. In the previous steps, we defined the page directly 		in the app view so that it is displayed when the app is loaded. We will now use the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> 		router class to load the pages and update the URL for us automatically. We specify a routing 		configuration for our app and create a separate view for each page of the app, then we 		connect the views by triggering navigation events</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="2366345a94f64ec1a80f9d9ce50a59ef.html">Step 32: Routing with Parameters</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">We can now navigate between the overview and the detail page, but the actual item that 		we selected in the overview is not displayed on the detail page yet. A typical use case for 		our app is to show additional information for the selected item on the detail page. To make 		this work, we have to pass over the information which item has been selected to the detail 		page and show the details for the item there.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="8ef57cfd37b44f089f7e3b52d56597eb.html">Step 33: Routing Back and History</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now we can navigate to our detail page and display an invoice, but we cannot go back to 		the overview page yet. We'll add a back button to the detail page and implement a function 		that shows our overview page again.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d12d2ee6a5454d799358d425f9e7c4db.html">Step 34: Custom Controls</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we are going to extend the functionality of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> with a custom control. 		We want to rate the product shown on the detail page, so we create a composition of multiple 		standard controls using the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> extension mechanism and add some glue code to make them 		work nicely together. This way, we can reuse the control across the app and keep all related 		functionality in one module.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="a96e18b4cd924196b255eb9623431dbb.html">Step 35: Responsiveness</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we improve the responsiveness of our app. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> applications can be run 		on  phone, tablet, and desktop devices and we can configure the application to make best use 		of the screen estate for each scenario. Fortunately, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> controls like the 			<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Table</samp> already deliver a lot of features that we can 		use.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d63a15e5eebb45cdada317bae5f45bc2.html">Step 36: Device Adaptation</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">We now configure the visibility and properties of controls based on the device that we 		run the application on. By making use of the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.Device</samp> API and defining 		a device model we will make the app look great on many devices.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d935dbf196d34997bf1ac42ac3e81579.html">Step 37: Content Density</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In the last step of our Walkthrough tutorial, we adjust the content density based on the 		user’s device. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> contains 		different content densities allowing you to display larger controls for touch-enabled 		devices and a smaller, more compact design for devices that are operated by mouse. In our 		app, we will detect the device and adjust the density accordingly.</div></li>

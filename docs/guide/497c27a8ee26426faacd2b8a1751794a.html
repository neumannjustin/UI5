<h1 class="title topictitle1">Theming</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is an HTML UI library, therefore styling is done using Cascading StyleSheets
		(CSS). This allows creating an impressive visual experience using a widely known standard
		technology which is well-accepted on the market.</p>
<p class="p"> <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> supports to create and use different visual designs - called <dfn class="term">themes</dfn> - that
			can be used alternatively and switched on the fly, thus allowing for the same
			application to have a very different look, depending on the user's design preference, or
			on accessibility requirements. Existing themes can serve as a base for new themes and in
			case of new design trends, it is possible to create a matching theme for all existing
			applications without modifying the applications. The abstraction level is that high that
			the theme handling is decoupled from application development and done on a separate
			layer. The <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> library takes care of loading the required CSS files and offers ways
			of switching themes.</p>
<p class="p">On top of pure CSS, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> offers a variety of optional features that add value regarding
			modularization, modification, compatibility and performance:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio497c27a8ee26426faacd2b8a1751794a__ul_plw_g2t_d4"><li class="li">CSS variables, mix-ins, color calculations and other functions, provided by the Open Source
				library LESS.</li>
<li class="li">In particular the CSS variables are used for centrally defined and centrally
				modifiable colors</li>
<li class="li">Compilation of one CSS file per control library out of modular per-control CSS
				files</li>
<li class="li">Optimization/compression of CSS size</li>
<li class="li">Clean browser switch and mobile platform detection available (inside CSS code)</li>
<li class="li">Base theme (as base for an always required style to reduce the amount of CSS
				required for specific themes)</li>
<li class="li">Generic Right-to-Left support</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To ensure these functions, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses the following components: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio497c27a8ee26426faacd2b8a1751794a__ul_pwp_fnt_f4"><li class="li">A CSS generator with several functions: LESS processing (CSS variables substitution
				etc.), merge of CSS files created for different themes and controls for optimal
				runtime consumption, as well as compression or right-to-left substitution if
				required.</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime takes care of loading the appropriate CSS file for the control
				libraries used in the application page by adding <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;style&gt;</samp> tags
				to the document head. There is also an API available for switching themes which
				replaces the CSS URLs and therefore does not modify the application state.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Options to theme your OpenUI5 application</div><div type="Options to theme your OpenUI5 application">
			
			<p class="p">To theme your application you can choose between different options:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio497c27a8ee26426faacd2b8a1751794a__ol_lg1_zmt_mn"><li class="li">You adapt an existing theme by using the UI theme designer, which
					basically modifies the color scheme, but in a very easy, non-technical manner
					with instant live preview. Adaptation parameters are limited, but the UI theme
					designer also allows adding custom CSS, which gives the freedom to adapt
					basically everything.</li>
<li class="li">Create a new theme from scratch, writing every piece of CSS which will be loaded
					later. The only requirement is to have <span class="ph filepath">library.css</span> files
					within a certain folder structure (which also defines the theme name).</li>
<li class="li">You adapt an existing theme by adding CSS on application level. This is the
					easiest option and still sufficient for many use-cases. One can technically
					adapt and change everything. The adaptation is rather done on top of an existing
					theme and only available within the specific application.</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">All options except the last one result in a new standalone theme which needs to be
				deployed and referenced by its name in the application and which could be used by
				any application.</p>

			<p class="p">In all options the CSS developer could choose to limit the styling effort to those
				controls which are actually used in the application (which of course limits the
				re-use value of the theme in other applications).</p>

				thrown for any route that matches to our route configuration in the descriptor file.
				In the event handler, we determine the name of the matched route from the event
				parameters and log it together with a time stamp. In an actual app, the information
				could be sent to a back-end system or an analytics server to find out more about the
				usage of your app.</p>

			<p class="p">Now you can access, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html#/employees</samp> while
				you have the console of the browser open. As you can see, there is a message logged
				for each navigation step that you do within the app.</p>

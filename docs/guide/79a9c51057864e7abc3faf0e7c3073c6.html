			<p class="p">In some cases an app needs to stay non-responsive for longer periods of time. This may be
				caused by the app fetching data or updating the UI. In these cases, busy indicators
				are shown to inform the user that the app is processing data.</p>

			<p class="p">The affected regions of the UI should have the property <samp class="ph codeph">aria-live</samp> set to
					<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>. This informs the screen reader that the region's DOM
				structure is currently subject to change and therefore internal processing should be
				applied.</p>

			<p class="p">Accessible events are designed as a signaling mechanism for screen readers. An example for
				this is when parts of the UI update, either as a result of a direct user action
				(such as performing a selection) or by software (such as <span class="q">“<cite class="cite">incoming
						mail</cite>”</span> messages or popups). Events like a dialog showing up or
				content updates of parts of the screen are handled by assigning specific roles and
				properties of the UI elements (for example, an HTML <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;input
					type=checkbox&gt;</samp> element, would need
					<samp class="ph codeph">role=<span class="q">“dialog”</span></samp> or property <samp class="ph codeph">aria-live</samp> set
				accordingly). Screen readers then listen to accessible events raised by browsers for
				these UI parts and react accordingly.</p>

			<p class="p">When the app is loading or fetching information, the ARIA property
						<samp class="ph codeph">aria-busy=<span class="q">“true”</span></samp> should be set for the corresponding
				region.</p>

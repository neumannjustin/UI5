			<p class="p">There are two different tutorial formats: Some tutorials start with an empty project
				and let you develop the whole app step by step, others start with an initial project
				in the first step that you can download from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app
				in the Demo Kit. You use the code from this initial project as a starting point for
				the subsequent tutorial steps.</p>

			<p class="p">Each step of the tutorial starts with a preview of the user interface (UI) which
				shows how it will look like after the step is accomplished.</p>

			<p class="p">It then displays the files that have to be changed in the step, highlighting the
				changed code, along with an explanation of the entire process.</p>

			<p class="p">You can view and download the files for all steps in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app
				in the Demo Kit. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app always contain the latest
				version of the sample code. So if you find differences to the coding in the step
				description,  follow the version in <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span>. Depending on
				your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths and
				configuration entries.</p>

			<p class="p">It also mentions the recommended conventions that should be adhered to, and contains

			<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
				<p class="p">You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly
					to any step you want. Just download the code from the previous step, copy it to
					your workspace and make sure that the application runs by calling the
						<samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html</samp> file.</p>

			<div class="p">You might have to adapt parts of the coding to your local development environment to
				make the app work. Please check the following settings carefully:<ul class="ul" id="loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__ul_gnb_qyf_rs"><li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Project Path and Deployment</span></p>

						<p class="p">All tutorials assume that the app is deployed and can be accessed under a
							certain path on a Web server. You will not be able to run the app
							without a Web server as the browser does not allow you to load the
							required resources locally due to security restrictions. </p>

						<p class="p">Depending on your server configuration and deployment mode, you will
							either have to include or exclude the <samp class="ph codeph">webapp</samp> folder in
							your URL path. If you choose to deploy the app to another path, you will
							have to adapt the file paths and URLs accordingly.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
								Resources</span></p>

						<p class="p">You can either download and deploy the runtime to your (local) Web server
							or reference the CDN version located at <span class="ph filepath">https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js</span>.
							Some development environments such as the <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>
							also provide a local runtime for testing purposes. If you download the
							code from the samples in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app, you
							will have to adapt the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">resource path in the bootstrap
								section</span> of all HTML pages included in the project. In the
							tutorial code, we assume that <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> can be accessed from
							the <samp class="ph codeph">/resources</samp> path of the server.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Accessing Remote Services</span></p>

						<p class="p">Browsers typically prevent accessing remote resources due to the
							Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. If you would like to call a
							real service or remote resources, you will have to either configure the
							development environment or the remote server to accept these requests.
							This strongly depends on the development environment and is described in
							more detail below.</p>

			<div class="p">If you get stuck on a certain tutorial step, please have a look at the developer
				console of your browser. Are there log messages displayed related to the error? Did
				it work before, and your recent change broke the app? Try reverting the previous
				change and test if the app can be run again. The most common errors are as
					follows:<ul class="ul" id="loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__ul_mdw_q1g_rs"><li class="li">

							HTML page you are trying to open. The path to the file
								<samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-core.js</samp> is probably incorrect and needs to
							point to the path where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> resources are located
							(typically globally under <samp class="ph codeph">/resources</samp> or locally under
								<samp class="ph codeph">resources</samp>).<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
								<p class="p">If you are running the tutorial in <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>,
									you will have to configure the project descriptor
										<samp class="ph codeph">neo-app.json</samp>. In this descriptor file, the
									path to the resources is already configured. Other development
									environments might need the resources to be copied to the
									server. Alternatively, you can use the CDN version of <span class="ph filepath">https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js</span>.</p>

<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">No texts from the resource bundle are displayed in the

						<p class="p">You are running the tutorial with an outdated version of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. Most tutorials need
							to be run with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> version 1.30 or
							higher, because the models are instantiated by the
								<samp class="ph codeph">manifest.json</samp> descriptor file. This feature is not
							available in release 1.28 and thus the models will not be loaded. As a
							workaround, you can instantiate the models manually in the
								<samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method of the app component.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">No model data in the application when trying to access a real
								service</span></p>

						<div class="p">Modern browsers prevent calling files and services from another server
							due to security restrictions. When accessing a remote service, you
							configure your application project or the remote server accordingly.
							Otherwise you will get a log message telling you that Cross-Origin
							Resource Sharing (CORS) is not configured and calling the remote URL is
							not allowed.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
								<p class="p">The configuration for calling remote services strongly depends on
									your development environment. All tutorials can be called with
									local test data instead if you are having trouble accessing a
									real service. Typically, the HTML page for running the app with
									local test data is called <samp class="ph codeph">testService.html</samp> and
									located in the <samp class="ph codeph">test</samp> folder of the app.</p>

			<p class="p">If these hints still don't help fix the problem in your app project, try downloading
				the solution of the current step or the next step of the tutorial from the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app. This should get your project fixed again,
				just don’t forget to check the resource path and the project configuration files
				again.</p>

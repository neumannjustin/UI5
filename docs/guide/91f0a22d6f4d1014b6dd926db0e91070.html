<h1 class="title topictitle1">Working with Controls</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Controls are used to define the appearance and behavior of screen areas.</p>
<p class="p">Controls consist of:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio91f0a22d6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__ul_vvw_cxj_1n"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">Control name</p>

				<p class="p">The control name is a string that consists of the library name and the control name,
					separated by a dot. The library name can be omitted if there is no need to
					assign the control to a library. It is possible, for example, to use
						<span class="keyword cmdname">Square</span> as control name. For controls that are reused by
					others, we recommend to use a unique library name, for example
						<span class="keyword cmdname">sap.byd.Square</span>.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Control metadata</p>

				<p class="p">The metadata defines the properties, events, aggregations and associations of a control.</p>

				<p class="p">Control properties, such as text or width, are used to modify the appearance or to relate to
					data that is displayed by the control. The controls are defined by the control
					metadata, which is the public API of the control. The API can be used by
					applications at runtime and also contains information on runtime features such
					as data binding and type validation checks.</p>

				<p class="p">Controls can aggregate other controls. These controls with aggregations serve as a container
					or layout control to which the application can add child controls. They can also
					serve as composite controls if the control itself adds child controls and reuses
					available components. In an aggregation, child controls are owned by the parent
					control and are destroyed together with the parent control. A control can only
					have one aggregation parent. Adding the control to another aggregation removes
					it from the previous parent control.</p>

				<p class="p">Associated controls are not part or children of an aggregation control. They are
					connected by ID instead of reference. Destroying a control in an association
					does not affect the other control. It is possible that an associated control
					does not yet or no longer exist.</p>

				<p class="p">Controls fire events. Events typically relate to the control's purpose and
					functionality on a semantically higher level than browser events such as
						<span class="keyword cmdname">click</span>. Examples for control events are
						<span class="keyword cmdname">triggerSearch</span> for a search field or
						<span class="keyword cmdname">collapse</span> in a panel.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Elements</p>

				<p class="p">Elements are parts of controls or rather configuration packages for parts of controls.
					Elements <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">cannot </span> be used standalone and do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> have
					their own renderer. Instead, the control that uses the element does the
					rendering: The <span class="keyword cmdname">ListBox</span> control, for example, renders the
						<span class="keyword cmdname">ListItem</span> elements. The information provided for controls
					also applies to elements but not to the renderer. The
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Element</samp> class is the base class of
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Control</samp>.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Methods</p>

				<p class="p">By convention, methods are public, unless their name starts with an underscore or if it is
					one of the special method types. When developing control libraries, public
					methods must be annotated with <samp class="ph codeph">@public</samp> in the JSDoc, and
					private methods with <samp class="ph codeph">@private</samp>. The generated getter/setter
					methods for properties are also public methods.</p>

				<p class="p">Methods are added to a new control by simply providing the implementation. It is not
					necessary to add the method to the metadata. Other controls and the application
					must only call public methods and the control ensures that they remain
					compatible. There are no technical rules that prevent the call of private
					methods, but it is not allowed.</p>

			</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The base class for all controls in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Control</samp>. To inherit
			and extend the functionality, specific controls can either inherit from the base class,
			or from another control.</p>

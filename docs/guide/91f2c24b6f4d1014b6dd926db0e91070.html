<h1 class="title topictitle1">Right-to-Left Support in Controls</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> supports
		right-to-left directionality (RTL) in controls.</p>
<p class="p">Unicode defines the direction in which a browser arranges characters to form words. CSS 2.1
			also provides a <samp class="ph codeph">direction</samp> property. The <samp class="ph codeph">dir</samp> attribute
			in HTML overrides the overall direction of blocks and influences the text alignment, if
			not set explicitly. The <samp class="ph codeph">lang</samp> attribute does <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span>
			influence the text direction.</p>
<p class="p">It is possible to use <samp class="ph codeph">document.dir</samp> for text direction. The browser supports it
			and it can be set in the bootstrap. The <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;bdo&gt;</samp> tag in HTML is used
			to control the bidirectional algorithm. This means that the character order is then not
			reversed if RTL and LTR words are mixed.</p>
<p class="p">In a nutshell, this means the following: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">Each character inherently belongs to an RTL or LTR script (defined by Unicode). Some
					characters like parentheses and dots have no inherent directionality. </p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Single words are interpreted by the browser as character sequences with the same
					directionality. For these, the browser knows the text direction and handles them
					as blocks that get their internal text direction <strong class="ph b">only</strong> from the used
					characters.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<div class="p">The words themselves are separated by the direction-neutral characters like parentheses,
					spaces and dots. This makes it possible for a single sentence
					to contain words with either directionality. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
						<p class="p">This behavior can be overridden by using the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;bdo&gt;</samp> tag or CSS
								<samp class="ph codeph">unicode-bidi:bidi-override</samp>. This is done when the
							order of characters must follow the base direction regardless of the
							inherent character direction. </p>

					</div>
</div>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The overall direction and how the blocks are put next to each other depends on the base
					direction of the whole HTML content.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The default base direction of HTML is left-to-right (LTR), but can be inverted by setting the
					attribute <samp class="ph codeph">"dir='rtl'"</samp>, either on the
						<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;html&gt;</samp> tag or on any sub-region which should have a
					different base direction.</p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">This base direction also determines the default text alignment, the order of columns in
					tables and the presentation of some direction-neutral characters. For example,
					opening parentheses are still opening parentheses when RTL mode is switched. </p>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">The algorithm for ordering blocks according to the base direction only covers one level of
					mixed directionality. To achieve deeper nesting, spans with a
						<samp class="ph codeph">dir</samp> attribute can be used to define a sub-context with a
					different base direction. </p>

			</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">If <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is configured for RTL
				mode, the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> core

					<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
						<p class="p">The W3C officially recommends using the HTML attribute instead of the CSS properties as
							directionality is determined by content and has nothing to do with the
							presentation. Another reason is that CSS properties can be ignored. They
							also recommend using the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;HTML&gt;</samp> tag instead of
							the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;BODY&gt;</samp> tag.</p>

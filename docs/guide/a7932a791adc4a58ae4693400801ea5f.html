			<div class="p">All we need to do is listen to the bypassed event on the router. If the bypassed event is
				triggered, we simply get the current hash and log a message. In an actual app this
				is probably the right place to add some application analysis features, i.e. sending
				analytical logs to the back-end for later evaluation and processing. This could be
				used to improve the app, for example, to find out why the user called the app with
				an invalid hash.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">We have chosen to place this piece of code into the <samp class="ph codeph">App</samp>
						controller because this is a global feature of the app. However, you could
						also place it anywhere else, for example in the <samp class="ph codeph">NotFound</samp>
						controller file or in a helper module related to analysis.</p>

				</div>
Now try to access <samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html#/thisIsInvalid</samp> while you
				have your browser console open. As you can see, there is a message that issues a
				faulty hash. Furthermore, our <samp class="ph codeph">NotFound</samp> page is still displayed.</div>

We could create a new route and a new view to visualize the resume again, but we could also simply reuse an existing route to cross-link the resume of a certain employee. In this step, we will add a feature that allows users to directly navigate to the resume of a certain employee. We will reuse the Resume page that we have created in an earlier step. This example illustrates that there can be multiple navigation paths that direct to the same page.">Step 15: Reuse an Existing Route</a><br/>

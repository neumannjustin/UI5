				<span class="ph">at <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/sample/sap.m.tutorial.testing.01/preview">Testing - Step 1</a></span>. Copy the code

			<p class="p">Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths and

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The Initial App</div><div type="The Initial App">
			
			<p class="p">With the downloaded coding, you have been handed over the bulletin board prototype that is set
				up according to the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> best practices
				and provides the following basic features of an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> app. If you have
				gone through the Walkthrough tutorial, you should be familiar with most of the
				source code in this step. Additional features of the app are:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_sv2_3kq_ls"><li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Entry Page</span></p>

					<p class="p">In this tutorial we will often switch between manually testing application
						features and running the automated tests. The
							<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/test.html</span> file provides a list of entry
						points for the app so that you do not have to enter the URLs manually. From
						this page you can open the app with mock data, run the unit tests, run the
						integration tests, or run the app’s test suite that will be added later in
						the tutorial. Note that in a productive scenario we would have an additional
						entry point that calls the app with a real service. As we do not (yet) have
						a real service for our prototype but operate on mock data we simply left
						this one out.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Home Page</span></p>

					<div class="p">The home page of our app is defined by the
							<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/testService.html</span> file. On this page, we
						initialize <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, start the mock server, and instantiate our app component. It only
						consists of a single view that displays a list of posts from a bulletin
						board with several attributes in a table.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
							<p class="p">We do not yet have a real service for the bulletin board prototype so run the app with
								mock data and this test page throughout the tutorial. The mock
								server helps in mimicking a real service and it processes requests
								with a small delay as a real service would do. This is perfect for
								realistic application testing and also helpful for local development
								tests. It is also a good practice to put all test pages in the test
								folder of the app.</p>

						</div>
</div>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Data</span></p>

					<div class="p">In the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/service/server.js</span> file the mock server is configured
						and in the same folder the mock data can be found. Using the mock server
						allows us to easily run the code even without network connection and without
						the need of having a remote server for our application data. The
							<span class="ph filepath">metadata.xml</span> file used by the mock server describes
						our OData service and can be replaced later by a real service. The service
						has just one OData entity:<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_fxr_y1y_2t"><li class="li">
								<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Post</span></p>

								<p class="p">A post consists of typical properties like
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Title</span>,
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Description</span>, and
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Price</span>. Each post is assigned to a
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Category</span> and a
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Contact</span>. The entity can be identified
									with its ID property: <samp class="ph codeph">PostID</samp>. The corresponding
										<samp class="ph codeph">EntitySet</samp> is <samp class="ph codeph">Posts</samp>. The
									actual test data containing several posts is located in the
										<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/service/posts.json</span>
									file.</p>

							</li>
</ul>
</div>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Testing Functionality</span></p>

					<div class="p">The team that created the first prototype already took care of the basic test
						setup. Most features related to application testing are shipped with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> and can
						simply be used within the app. The testing infrastructure is set up in the
							<span class="ph filepath">test</span> folder that is located in the
							<span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder of the app:<ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_kmn_gby_2t"><li class="li">
								<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Mock Server</span></p>

								<p class="p">The mock server is set up in the
										<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/service/server.js</span> file. It
									loads the metadata and the mock data in the same folder. This is
									defined in the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> descriptor
									file with the model configuration and service URL configuration.
									We can access the posts in the app and the worklist already
									displays an initial set of properties for the posts. There is a
									one second delay configured for all requests to mimic a slow
									backend server.</p>

							</li>
<li class="li">
								<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Unit Tests</span></p>

								<p class="p">All unit tests are located in the
										<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/unit</span> folder and can be
									started by calling the <span class="ph filepath">unitTests.qunit.html</span>
									file in the same folder. Initially, there are only a few tests
									for model instantiation and formatters that cover basic
									functionality in the prototype. We will explain more details
									about the unit test set up later.</p>

							</li>
<li class="li">
								<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Integration Tests</span></p>

								<p class="p">Integration tests are written in OPA5 – a tool for integration
									testing that is included in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> – and can be found in the
										<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/integration</span> folder. You can
									start all OPA tests by calling the
										<span class="ph filepath">opaTests.qunit.html</span> file in the same
									folder. OPA tests are organized in test journeys, and there is
									already a worklist journey included that checks if the table of
									posts is displayed properly. We will explain more details about
									the integration test set up later.</p>

							</li>
</ul>
</div>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Other quality-related features of the app</span></p>

					<div class="p">The app is set up using an application template for full-screen apps that already contains
						many helpful features. The most important ones are named here. <ul class="ul" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__ul_lcw_wby_2t"><li class="li">
								<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Separation of concerns (MVC)</span></p>

								<p class="p">Following the best practice approach of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, all artifacts are located in either the
										<span class="ph filepath">model</span>, <span class="ph filepath">view</span>, or
										<span class="ph filepath">controller</span> folder of the app. The app’s
									component and its descriptor is configuring which artifacts to
									load and the routing setup is controlling the navigation flow of
									the app.</p>

							</li>
</ul>
</div>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Separation of productive and non-productive code</span></p>

					<p class="p">All non-productive code is located in the <span class="ph filepath">test</span>
						subfolder. This includes the unit and integration tests, mock server and
						mock data, and the test page to call the app with mock data. All productive
						code is located in the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder. This makes it
						easy to remove test-related artifacts before deploying the productive
						app.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Busy handling</span></p>

					<p class="p">As a best practice, users should always get instant feedback when triggering
						actions and navigating in the app. The app already includes functionality to
						display a busy indication when data is loaded or actions are triggered. To
						simulate a slow backend and show the behavior of the app the mock server is
						configured with a delay of one second for each request.</p>

				</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">Now we have a running prototype that we can further extend with additional tests and
				features. Make sure the app is running by calling the test page, the unit tests, and
				the integration tests from the entry page
				<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/test.html</span>. The app should display a list of
				bulletin board posts as seen in the screenshot above and the tests should run
				without errors.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Test Strategy</div><div type="Test Strategy">
			
			<p class="p">Let’s first take a look at best practices for testing apps written in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>. JavaScript is a
				dynamic programming language and only some issues can be detected by static code
				check tools and manual testing. Automated tests that execute the code regularly are
				beneficial for good quality and development productivity - especially when you're
				developing in short development cycles.</p>

			<p class="p">We expect our prototype to be released and shipped as a product soon, so we need a
				solid testing strategy. Fortunately the prototype team has already thought ahead and
				prepared a unit and integration testing infrastructure that is included in the app.
				The mock server is also set up and allows us to test the app with local test data
				instead of a real backend.</p>

			<div class="p">This is a really good starting point for further enhancements of the app and we can
				use the mock data for writing reliable integration tests that do not run against a
				real service backend which might be unavailable when the tests are run.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">If you start developing an app from scratch, you should always consider
						testing from the very beginning of the software lifecycle. Nobody wants to
						write test for undocumented code and make assumptions about the logic. It
						will pay off many times to think about code checks, unit and integration
						testing and a solid testing strategy from the start.</p>

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="p">Before you start implementing your first test, you should think about how to test the
				different aspects of your application. The image below shows the testing tools along
				the agile testing pyramid.</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__fig_u2g_t2y_2t"><div class="figcontainer"><img class="image" id="loioab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5__image_tpl_52y_2t" src="loio88758c3b4ad94e9ca6508d106fe66972_HiRes.png"/><div class="figcap">Figure 3:
					Testing pyramid</div></div></div>

			<p class="p"> When we think about application testing, we want to automate as much of the testing
				steps as possible. When we immediately write a test for all the features that we
				implement then we can greatly reduce manual testing efforts that are time consuming
				and cumbersome. Whenever we change something later, we can simply run the existing
				tests and see if the functionality is still working as expected.</p>

			<p class="p">The two tools that are included in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> for testing are
				QUnit for unit testing and OPA for integration testing. The foundation for our
				testing pyramid are the unit tests and they should validate the most important logic
				of our app. On top, we can write integration tests for more interaction-related
				functionality like interacting with UI elements of the app. </p>

			<div class="p">There might still be things that are hard to test with these client-side testing frameworks.
				Certain features might require a more sophisticated system test, like a screenshot
				comparison that can be implemented with additional testing frameworks. And of
				course, you should from time to time do some manual testing to make sure that the
				app is really doing what you expect.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">In this tutorial we will focus on writing clean unit and integration tests
						for apps. They build the foundation and are crucial for good application
						quality. We will also outline how to write testable code. Not all
						implementation patterns can be tested easily. But when writing the test code
						together with the implementation code as in this tutorial it is a natural
						result.</p>

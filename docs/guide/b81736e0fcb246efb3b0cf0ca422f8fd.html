<div class="p">The product team requested a feature format the price with a certain status depending on
			amount. As we use Test Driven Development (TDD) we define the test case first, before we
			actually implement the feature. So we will now start by implementing a test for the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Price State</span> feature. Naturally the test will fail until the
			feature is implemented in the next step.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development model that relies on a
					very short development cycle and can be combined very easily with pair
					programming. When using TDD a developer first writes a failing automatic test
					case to describe the behavior of a new feature or functionality. As soon as the
					test fails (due to the still missing implementation) the role of the developer
					switches to the implementation. The code is added to make the test run
					successful and then the cycle starts over again.</p>

				<p class="p">There might also be iterations where the just the implementation or testing code
					is refactored to make it more elegant. TDD reduces complexity while maintaining
					high test coverage of the application coding at the same time.</p>

			<div class="p">Let’s take a closer look at the <span class="ph filepath">unitTests.qunit.html</span> file. The
				application root is stored in the <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder two levels
				above. In the <samp class="ph codeph">bootstrap</samp> tag of the HTML page we define two
				namespaces to refer to  the app and the unit tests. The namespace of the unit tests
				points to the current folder as all test artifacts are located below the current
					folder:<ul class="ul" id="loiob81736e0fcb246efb3b0cf0ca422f8fd__ul_hkp_vyd_ft"><li class="li">
						<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.demo.bulletinboard: "../../"</samp></p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">test.unit: "./" </samp></p>

					</li>
</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">The namespace abstraction allows us to refer to all application and testing parts
				without having to use the full path. Furthermore, all unit tests are put in a
				similar folder structure and get the same name as the artifact that is tested. For
				example, the tests for the file <span class="ph filepath">webapp/model/formatter.js</span> are
				located in the <span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/unit/model/formatters.js</span> folder. For
				more details on the unit test setup please have a look at the coding of the
				prototype.</p>

});</pre></div>

			<p class="p">First we think about the feature that we want to implement. We want to introduce a new state
				for the price, and its value should depend on certain price ranges. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> controls
				typically have semantic states like <span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>,
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>, or <span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>. We will need
				this formatter function to convert the numeric price value from the model to a state
				value for the control. But without caring too much about the actual implementation
				of this formatter we just add an empty function <samp class="ph codeph">priceState</samp> to the
				formatter file for now and focus on the unit tests first.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.js</div><div type="webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.js">

		QUnit.test("Should format the products with a price lower than 50 to Success", function (assert) {

			});
		});
</span>
	}
);</pre></div>

			<p class="p">Now we write tests that call the function we have just defined and check for the correct
				result when passing in various arguments. </p>

			<div class="p">By writing these tests, we actually implement the following specification in our
				tests that was defined by the product team:<ul class="ul" id="loiob81736e0fcb246efb3b0cf0ca422f8fd__ul_nkv_cc2_ft"><li class="li">
						<p class="p">price &lt; 50: Status is green (<span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>)</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">price &gt;= 50 and price &lt; 250: Status is normal
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>)</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">price &gt;= 250 and price &lt; 500: Status is orange
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>)</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">price &gt;= 500: Status is red (<span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>) </p>

					</li>
</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">Whenever we run the tests, we will implicitly check that the features is still
				working as it was designed. To keep it simple, we should only write a minimum set of
				tests that cover the most important cases, but also including edge cases like the
				value 50 or  unexpected values. </p>

			<p class="p">Let’s have a look at the implementation of the unit tests now: We add our unit tests to the
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.js</span> file. The path below
				the app and the test folder is similar so it can easily associate the test with the
				tested functionality. There are already formatter functions for the number unit
				conversion defined in the code - you can give a quick look to them before we add our
				own tests.</p>

			<div class="p">We add a new QUnit module for our price state tests after the number unit conversion
				tests. We could write a test checking the result of the formatter for each of these
				cases but we do not want to repeat ourselves (<span class="q">“DRY”</span>) – neither in the tests nor
				in the application coding – so we create a reuse function called
					<samp class="ph codeph">priceStateTestCase</samp>. In this function, we call the formatter
				with the arguments provided as <samp class="ph codeph">oOptions</samp> and make a
					<samp class="ph codeph">strictEqual</samp> assertion for the expected parameter.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">There must be at least one assertion per QUnit test. If the actual value
						matches the expected value then the test is successful. However, if there
						are more assertions in a test case and a subsequent assertion fails, the
						whole test fails with the error message of the failed assertion.</p>

					<p class="p">There are also other types of assertions, for example the <samp class="ph codeph">ok</samp>
						assertion that does not check the type. For more details, have a look at the
						official QUnit documentation. </p>

				</div>
</div>

			<div class="p">The assert object – a special object injected by QUnit – is passed on as a reference to the
				function. QUnit is loaded once for the whole unit testing part of the app. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">The main page for calling the unit tests is
							<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html</span>. In this file
						we load the QUnit runtime and an <samp class="ph codeph">allTests.js</samp> file that
						loads and directly executes all files with unit tests. The other content of
						this file is just HTML for displaying the QUnit test result page.</p>

				</div>
</div>

			<p class="p"> And now for the actual test cases: Whenever we want to start a new test we call
					<span class="ph filepath">QUnit.test</span> with a test description and a callback function
				containing the test logic as an argument. The callback is invoked with a special
				assert object that is maintained by QUnit. We can simply call assertions as we saw
				above. </p>

			<p class="p">Inside each test we simply call our reuse function with different parameters for the
				price and the expected state that reflect our specification above. With five tests
				we can check the most important cases for our price state converter. There are four
				tests for the four different states and one edge case test with the value
					<samp class="ph codeph">50</samp>, that makes sure that the correct state is chosen.</p>

			<p class="p">That’s it, you just wrote your first unit test. When you call the
					<span class="ph filepath">webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html</span> file in your browser,
				you can see that the first module for the number unit formatter is still green but
				our price state tests are red and failing. The error message tells us that the
				result of the empty formatter function is not as expected.</p>

			<p class="p">TDD methodology tells us to do the implementation as soon as the test fails and to
				come back to testing as soon as the tests are successful again. You run the unit
				tests after each code change, and you're done when the test does not fail anymore.
				We  now switch to the implementation part and define the details of the formatter
				function in the next step.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses data binding to bind
			two data sources or information sources together to keep them in sync: All changes in
			one source are also reflected in the other one.</p>
<p class="p">For data binding, you need a model and a binding instance: The model instance holds the data
			and provides methods to set the data or to retrieve the data from a server. It also
			provides a method for creating bindings to the data. When this method is called, a
			binding instance is created, which contains the binding information and provides an
			event, which is fired whenever the bound data changes. An element can listen to this
			event and update its visualization according to the new data.</p>
<p class="p">The UI uses data binding to bind controls to the model which holds the application data, so
			that the controls are updated automatically whenever application data changes The data
			binding is also used the other way round, when changes in the control cause updates in
			the underlying application data, for example data entered by the user. This is called
			two-way binding.</p>

				<p class="p">You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly
					to any step you want. Just download the code from the previous step, copy it to
					your workspace and make sure that the application runs by calling the
						<samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html</samp> file.</p>

				<p class="p">You can view and download the files for all steps in the
						<span class="ph uicontrol">Explored</span> app in the demo kit <span class="ph">at <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.databinding/samples">Data Binding</a></span>. Depending on your development environment you
					might have to adjust resource paths and configuration entries.</p>

<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we simply place some text on the screen using a standard 			<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Text</samp> control. The text in this control is a hard-coded part of 		the control's definition; therefore, this is not an example of data binding!</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="5278bfd38f3940b192df0e39f2fb33b3.html">Step 2: Creating a Model</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In this step, we create a model as container for the data on which your application 		operates.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d70e9894c09b4c27a98d4850d4e90f2c.html">Step 3: Create Property Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Although there is no visible difference, the text on the screen is now derived from 		model data.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="c72b922fdb59422496661000165d7ff1.html">Step 4: Two-Way Data Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In the examples used so far, we have used a read-only field to display the value of a 		model property. We will now change the user interface so that the first and last name fields 		are displayed using <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Input</samp> fields and an additional check box control 		is used to enable or disable both input fields. This arrangement illustrates a feature known 		as "two-way data binding". Now that the view contains more controls, we will also move the 		view definition into an XML file.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="88756c08fe144ba08ff1762ad92fc07c.html">Step 5: One-Way Data Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In contrast to the two-way binding behavior shown above, one-way data binding is also 		possible. Here, data is transported in one direction only: from the model, through the 		binding instance to the consumer (usually the property of a control), but never in the other 		direction. In this example, we will change the previous example to use one-way data binding. 		This will illustrate how the flow of data from the user interface back to the model can be 		switched off if required.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="9790d9aa686e4f818f2ad99057adb7ee.html">Step 6: Resource Models</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Business applications also require language-specific (translatable) texts used as labels 		and descriptions on the user interface.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4e593b44e78a431e8b21be6b3915fb55.html">Step 7: (Optional) Resource Bundles and Multiple Languages</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">The reason we have resource bundles is to allow an app to run in multiple languages 		without the need to change any code. To demonstrate this feature, we will create a German 		version of the app – in fact all we need to do is create a German version of the resource 		bundle file. No code changes are needed.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="9373793b290d429ba1bc6aea1ce5482f.html">Step 8: Binding Paths: Accessing Properties in Hierarchically Structured Models</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">In step 6 , we stated that the fields in a resource model are arranged in a flat 		structure; in other words, there can be no hierarchy of properties; however, this is true 		only for resource models. The properties within JSON and OData models almost always are 		arranged in a hierarchical structure. Therefore, we should take a look at how to reference 		fields in a hierarchically structured model object.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="6fdf0acd0bc24ffdad327cf7e6f9e7e0.html">Step 9: Formatting Values</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">How can we make our example more useful? Let’s use the address data we have to show the 		address location on a map. For this we will use the openly available Google Maps API. (Make 		sure you meet Google’s terms and conditions if you decide to use their API in your 		applications.) So in this step we will look at how model property values can be 		programmatically formatted according to the requirements of the Maps API.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="9252ee4015f24fc49c71c295394d1b8d.html">Step 10: Property Formatting Using Data Types</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> provides a set of 		simple data types such as <samp class="ph codeph">Boolean</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">Currency</samp>, 			<samp class="ph codeph">Date</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">Float</samp>. These data types can then be applied 		to controls in order to ensure firstly that the value presented on the screen is formatted 		correctly, and secondly, if the field is open for input that the value entered by the user 		conforms to the requirements of that data type. We will now add a new field called 			Sales to Date and declare it to be of type 			<samp class="ph codeph">Currency</samp>. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="b8c4e534cdb440e9a5bbff86f9572bd6.html">Step 11: Validation Using the Message Manager</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">So far, we have created a currency field that can do little more than format itself 		correctly. The currency data type also has the ability to validate that user input conforms 		to the requirements of a currency; however, data type validation functions are managed by 			<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, which of itself has 		no mechanism for reporting error messages back to the UI; therefore, we need a mechanism for 		reporting error messages raised by validation functions back to the user. In this step, we 		will connect the entire view to a feature known as the <span class="q">“Message Manager”</span>. Once this 		connection has been made, any validation error messages generated by the user's input will 		be passed to the message manager which in turn, will connect them to the appropriate view 		and control that caused the error.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="97830de2d7314e93b5c1ee3878a17be9.html">Step 12: Aggregation Binding Using Templates</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Aggregation binding allows a control to be bound to a list within the model data and     allows relative binding to the list entries by its child controls.  </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="6c7c5c266b534e7ea9a28f861dc515f5.html">Step 13: Element Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Now we want to do something with that newly generated list. In most cases you will use a 		list to allow the selection of an item and then show the details of that item elsewhere. In 		order to achieve this, we use a form with relatively bound controls an bind it to the 		selected entity via element binding.</div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="5cff8d1c3fb84c5db7a00f2daca125af.html">Step 14: Expression Binding</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Expression binding allows you to display a value on the screen that has been calculated 		from values found in some model object. This way simple formatting or calculations can be 		inserted directly into the data binding string. In this example, we will change the color of 		the price depending on whether it is above or below some arbitrary threshold. The threshold 		value is also stored in the JSON model. </div></li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="284a036c8ff943238fb65bf5a2676fb7.html">Step 15: Aggregation Binding Using a Factory Function</a></strong><br/>
<div class="linkdesc">Instead of hard-coding a single template control, we will use a factory function to 		generate different controls based on the data received at runtime. This approach is much 		more flexible and allows complex or heterogeneous data to be displayed.</div></li>

<div class="linkdesc">You use data binding to bind UI controls to the model, which holds the application data, 		so that the controls are updated automatically whenever application data is changed. The 		data binding is also used when changes in the control cause updates in the underlying 		application data, such as data being entered by a user.
